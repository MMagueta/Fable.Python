# Fable Python

Python bindings for Fable. This library will eventually contain Python (stdlib)
bindings for Fable.

## Usage

TBW

## Auto-generation

Parts of this library could benefit from code-generation based on the type
annotations in Python [typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed) similar to
ts2fable. Even so we should keep this library manually updated based on PRs to
ensure the quality of the code.
